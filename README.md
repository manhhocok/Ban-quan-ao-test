# VueJS Fundamentals Company Assignment

- The main project folder that for learning, practicing and passing assignment of VueJS Fundamentals Company's Internal Course
- This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite.
- [Demo here](https://vuejs-fundamentals-assignment.vercel.app)

## You will find in this repo the following stuff

- An eCommerce web application build by VueJS 3
- Global state management using Pinia
- Using public API by [Fake Store API](https://fakestoreapi.com/)
- Etcetera

## Functional Requirements:

1. **User authentication**: Allows users to create an account, login `only accepts accounts provided by FakeStoreAPI` and manage their profile.
2. **Product catalog**: Has a catalog of all the available products for sale. The catalog should include a picture of each product, its name, price, and a brief description.
3. **Shopping cart**: Allows users to add products to their shopping cart, view their cart, and checkout when ready.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).

## Type Support for `.vue` Imports in TS

TypeScript cannot handle type information for `.vue` imports by default, so we replace the `tsc` CLI with `vue-tsc` for type checking. In editors, we need [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin) to make the TypeScript language service aware of `.vue` types.

If the standalone TypeScript plugin doesn't feel fast enough to you, Volar has also implemented a [Take Over Mode](https://github.com/johnsoncodehk/volar/discussions/471#discussioncomment-1361669) that is more performant. You can enable it by the following steps:

1. Disable the built-in TypeScript Extension
   1. Run `Extensions: Show Built-in Extensions` from VSCode's command palette
   2. Find `TypeScript and JavaScript Language Features`, right click and select `Disable (Workspace)`
2. Reload the VSCode window by running `Developer: Reload Window` from the command palette.
